How to read the cvMat Object:

CvMat is a matrix data structure, which is the basic data type of OpenCV. It just like a 2-D array. We can find the definition of the create fuction:

cvMat* cvCreateMat ( int rows, int cols, int type ); 

So, in order to read a CvMat object, we can use pointer to access the value in CvMat or input its row and col to access every pixel.

What is the order of pixel structure:
As for the pixel structure, every pixel contains three channel values to make a color --- R,G,B.
