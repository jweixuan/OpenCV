CvMat is a matrix data structure, which is the basic data type of OpenCV. We can find the definition of the create fuction:

cvMat* cvCreateMat ( int rows, int cols, int type ); 

So, in order to read a CvMat object, we can use pointer to access the value in CvMat.

As for the pixel structure, every pixel contains three values to make a color --- R,G,B.
