Change the kernel sizes for all the filters with all different values for noises
and print the results for 3x3, 5x5 and 7x7 kernels.

Salt_pepper noise is created when the methods deal with images. This noise is some white(salt) and black(pepper)pixels on the image.
So, the result of Salt_pepper image has lots of light point on the image, just like the salt.

Gauss noise: The so-called Gaussian noise refers to a type of noise whose probability density function obeys Gaussian distribution.
The probability density of Gaussian noise obeys Gaussian distribution (normal distribution) which has means (mean) 
and sigma (standard deviation) two parameters.

The difference between 3*3, 5*5 and 7*7, we can detect that as the size increase, the image get more blurring.

And, Median filter works better for salt_pepper noise.
Gaussian filter works better for Gauss noise.
